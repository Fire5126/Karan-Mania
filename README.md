# Karen Mania

A game developed throughout year 11 and 12 for a major project at AIE during our VET course, Fundamentals of Game Design, made in unity, Karen Mania is a top down, endless, wave shooter for smart phones. Made through an agile pipeline, utilising sprints and stand ups to efficiently develop this game.
